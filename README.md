# How thumbnails work
Since 05/10/2020, DFL supports the display of thumbnails for PHP and HTML files. To do this, you have to create a thumbnail, with a screenshot for example, that you place in the folder "/icoSystem/thumbnails" in ".jpg" format and not ".JPG" by giving the image the same name as the associated file.
